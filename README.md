# Programming Examples

This repository is a set of many simple programming problems implemented in several different languages.
The purpose of this repository is to provide examples for people just starting out with programming.

## Contributing

When adding examples, please make sure to follow the following guidelines:

1. Make sure to comment your code - this repository is meant to be a resource for beginners, so it should be very clear what your code is doing.
This includes making it clear what problem you're solving - make sure you include a brief summary of the task you're trying to accomplish.

2. Include only source files - don't include compiled code like `.class` files for Java, `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files for Python, etc.

3. Each program should go in a directory with the name of the language - if one doesn't exist, create it.
If your program uses more than one file, make a subdirectory within the main language directory for it.
All files in the main directory should be standalone programs; they shouldn't rely on any other files.

4. Don't use any external libraries - all examples should be written entirely with tools and libraries built into the language you're using.

For ideas on what problems to solve, [see this issue](https://github.com/RUCS24/ProgrammingExamples/issues/1).
Note that you can still include solutions to other problems, as long as they are reasonably simple enough for beginners to understand
(Adding an AES implementation is probably not a great idea).
